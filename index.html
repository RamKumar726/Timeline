There is no doubt in the fact that the field of mining occupies a major section of the countryâ€™s economy. Yet, risking thousands of human lives, just to inspect the potential of these areas is not acceptable. Thus, itâ€™s essential that major steps are taken to reduce rather alleviate the use of manual labour in the mining sites while carrying out the inspection process.</p></div>">
